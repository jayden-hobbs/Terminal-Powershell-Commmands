# Terminal and Powershell-Commmands
A collection of codes which are example of common commands within Windows Terminal, Powershell and Kali Linux Terminal. This is a collection to use as a reference as I study my Degree at Leeds Beckett University in Cyber Security.

Each code wil have the command 'pause' if required to make sure you can run the code directly from file explorer. Once you press a key, the program will terminate.
